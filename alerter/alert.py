    "DoS Attack": "A Denial of Service (DoS) attack aims to shut down a machine or network, making it inaccessible to its intended users by overwhelming it with traffic.",
    "MITM Detected": "Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks involve an attacker secretly relaying and possibly altering the communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other.",
    "Port Scanning Detected": "Port scanning is a method used by attackers to discover vulnerable services that they can potentially exploit on a networked computer.",
    "Malicious Destination IP Detected": "The system has identified a connection attempt to an IP address that is known for suspicious activities, as listed in our threat intelligence database from IOCs Feeds Platform.",
    "Malicious Source IP Detected": "A network connection was initiated from an IP address recognized for harmful activities, as listed in our threat intelligence database from IOCs Feeds Platform.",
    "Frequent DNS Queries": "A high number of DNS queries in a short period may suggest suspicious activity, such as DNS tunneling or data exfiltration.",
    "High Traffic Anomaly": "A significant increase in network traffic could indicate a potential attack, such as a DDoS, or a misconfigured network device.",
    "High Entropy DGA Domain Detected": "A domain generated by a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) has been detected, often used by malware to evade detection by frequently changing its domain names.",
    "HTTP Flood Detected": "An HTTP flood attack aims to overwhelm a server with HTTP requests, causing a denial of service to legitimate users.",
    "ICMP Tunneling Detected": "ICMP tunneling is a method of using ICMP packets to covertly transmit data, potentially indicating data exfiltration or covert communication channels.",
    "Frequent ICMP Packets": "An unusual number of ICMP packets could indicate network scanning or ICMP tunneling, which is often used for reconnaissance or covert communication.",
    "Unusual SMB Authentication Frequency": "A high frequency of SMB authentication attempts may suggest a brute force attack, where an attacker is attempting to guess passwords to gain access to a network.",
    "Multiple SMB Authentication Attempts": "Multiple failed SMB authentication attempts could indicate a brute force attack, where an attacker is trying to gain unauthorized access by guessing passwords.",
    "Multiple SMB Session IDs": "Multiple SMB session IDs from a single IP may indicate suspicious activity, such as an attempt to evade detection by using multiple sessions.",
    "Possible TLS MITM Detected": "Potential man-in-the-middle activity detected on a TLS connection, which could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the encrypted communication.",
    "LLMNR Poisoning Detected": "Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) poisoning is an attack where an attacker responds to LLMNR requests intended for other hosts, potentially redirecting traffic to malicious sites.",
    "NBT-NS Poisoning Detected": "NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) poisoning is similar to LLMNR poisoning, where an attacker responds to NBT-NS requests, potentially redirecting traffic to malicious sites.",
    "IP Spoofing Detected": "IP spoofing involves sending packets with a false source IP address, potentially used to bypass IP-based authentication or to disguise the origin of an attack.",
    "P2P Communication Detected": "Peer-to-peer (P2P) communication detected on the network, which could be used for legitimate purposes or for malicious activities such as file sharing of illegal content.",
    "MAC Flooding Detected": "MAC flooding involves sending numerous packets to a switch, each with a different source MAC address, potentially causing the switch to enter a fail-open mode and broadcast traffic to all ports.",
    "Frequent MAC Changes Detected": "Frequent changes in MAC addresses on a network interface may indicate spoofing or a scanning tool, potentially used to evade detection or to perform reconnaissance.",
    "IP Null Scan Detected": "An IP Null scan is a type of network scan where the attacker sends packets with no TCP flags set, potentially used to identify open ports by observing the target's response.",
    "RST/FIN Flood Detected": "RST/FIN flooding involves sending a large number of TCP RST or FIN packets to a target, potentially disrupting legitimate TCP connections or exhausting resources.",
    "Possible DNS over HTTPS (DoH) Detected": "This detection indicates potential use of DNS over HTTPS (DoH), which could be used to bypass traditional DNS monitoring mechanisms and obscure DNS queries from security tools.",
    "HTTP/S Beaconing Detected": "HTTP/S beaconing involves periodic communication between a compromised device and a command and control server, often indicating malware activity and the presence of an advanced persistent threat.",
    "Tor Exit Node Traffic Detected": "Traffic to or from known Tor exit nodes has been detected, which may indicate anonymized communication often associated with malicious activity, such as browsing the dark web or bypassing censorship.",
